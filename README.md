### Lesson Outline
**1. What is Linux?**

![What is Linux?](https://github.com/3DCdsc/Cloud_2021/blob/master/linux%20logo.png)

Linux is a platform of choice to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the globe, Linux is one of the most reliable, secure and worry-free operating systems available. Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn't function. Linux is the leading operating system on servers (over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux),[28] leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers (since November 2017, having gradually eliminated all competitors).

***Fun Fact:***
SpaceX's Falcon 9's and the Dragon 2's avionics use a customized version of Linux! 



**2. What is Command Line Interface (CLI)?**

CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.
In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.
In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.
Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).
However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.
Linux's CLI is called _Terminal_ while Window's CLI is called _Command Prompt (CMD)_
